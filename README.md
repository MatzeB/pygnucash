# pygnucash - read gnucash files in python

## 1. Introduction

This repository contains code to read sqlite3 files as produced by gnucash
version 2.6 and higher. It features two proof of concepts scripts:

* gnucash2ledger.py convert a gnucash file to a ledger-cli file
* stockreport.py Summarizes your wins/losses with stocks/mutual funds (contrary to the gnucash builtin reports this one recognizes taxes/fees on dividend transactions)

## 2. Requirements

* python 3.x (tested on 3.6, may or may not work on other versions on 2.x)

## Author/Contact
